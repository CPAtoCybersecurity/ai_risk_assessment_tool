# [System Name] Risk Assessment

**Assessment Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Assessor:** [Name]
**Tier:** 1 / 2 / 3
**Status:** Draft / Pending Approval / Approved / Risk Accepted

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: What was assessed, key findings, overall risk rating, recommendation]

**Overall Risk Rating:** Low / Medium / High / Critical

**Recommendation:** Approve / Approve with Conditions / Reject / Defer

## Lethal Trifecta Check

| Factor | Present | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Private data access | Yes / No | [Describe: databases, emails, APIs, files, credentials] |
| Untrusted input | Yes / No | [Describe: webhooks, emails, Slack, public APIs, user content] |
| External communication | Yes / No | [Describe: HTTP requests, posting to GitHub/Slack, sending emails] |

**Trifecta Status:**
